# Initial Setup and Troubleshooting Log

This document logs critical issues encountered during the initial Miko Mini setup and provides solutions verified by the Beta Team.

## 1. Device Charging Procedure
* **Issue:** Device does not charge when plugged in while powered off.
* **Resolution:** Confirmed that Miko Mini **charges only when it is turned ON** (power button pressed before plugging in). This is a vital difference from standard device charging protocols.

## 2. Spanish Language Update/Localization
* **Issue:** Miko remained in English even after the Spanish update was pushed remotely by the Miko Team.
* **Workaround:** The user manually triggered the language switch by saying the command: **"Hey Miko, can you speak in Spanish?"** This resolved the issue and allowed the device to begin responding in Spanish.

*Conclusion: Successfully ensured Miko was updated and fully operational in the primary testing language (Spanish) before commencing Cycle 1 activities.*
