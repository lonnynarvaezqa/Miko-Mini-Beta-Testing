# Miko Mini Beta Program: Test Cases Log

## Introduction

This log serves as the official documentation for all **Quality Assurance (QA) test cases** executed during my participation in the Miko Mini Beta Program. The testing activities are directly derived from the weekly challenges and objectives provided by the Miko Beta Team via Slack.

The primary focus of these tests is to validate Miko Mini's core functionality, with a strong emphasis on **Artificial Intelligence (AI) interactions**, **voice recognition**, **multilingual command processing**, and **usability**.

All cycles are documented sequentially below, including the test objectives, detailed steps, expected results, and measurable criteria for success.

---

## Cycle 0: Initial Setup, Charging Protocol, and Language Activation

##  Testing Objectives

This cycle validates the fundamental hardware setup and configuration steps, which must be successfully completed before any functional or AI testing (Cycle 1 and beyond) can commence.

The primary objectives were to:
1.  Verify the correct **device charging protocol**.
2.  Ensure successful **software update** installation.
3.  Confirm **Spanish language activation** for all subsequent testing.

FAIL if the device charges unexpectedly. |
| **C0-HW-02** | **Charge Indicator Check** | Turn Miko ON, then connect the charger. Leave plugged in overnight. | The device must **maintain or increase** its battery charge. | PASS if the charge is maintained/increased. FAIL if the battery status shows a drain or zero charge. |

### Section B: Language Localization and Software Update

| Test Case ID | Test Item | Test Steps | Expected Result | Pass/Fail Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **C0-SW-01** | **Update Confirmation** | Verify Wi-Fi connection and ensure the remote Spanish update is pushed and downloaded. | Miko Mini must successfully complete the **latest software update** without freezing or crashing. | PASS if the update completes successfully. FAIL if the device hangs during the update process. |
| **C0-SW-02** | **Language Default Check** | After the remote update, prompt Miko with a simple question. | Miko Mini should **automatically respond in Spanish** (the target language). | PASS if Spanish is the default language. FAIL if the device remains in English or another language. |
| **C0-SW-03** | **Manual Language Activation (Troubleshooting)** | If C0-SW-02 fails, command Miko: **"Hey Miko, can you speak in Spanish?"** | Miko must successfully and permanently switch to **Spanish** and begin responding fully in the target language. | PASS if the language switches fully and remains. FAIL if the switch is temporary or limited. |

---

## Cycle 1: Voice Recognition and Multilingual Command Testing
##  Testing Objectives

This cycle's primary objective is to evaluate Miko Mini's **voice detection, keyword recognition, and language switching capabilities** across different users (child/parent) and accents (natural, non-standard English/Spanish).

The test specifically targets Miko’s ability to reliably:
1.  **Wake Up:** Recognize the "Hey Miko" wake word from different speakers (child and adult) under various acoustic conditions (natural accent, short pauses).
2.  **Process Multilingual Input:** Accept a command that seamlessly switches from an English trigger ("Hey Miko") to a Spanish request (`¿cuál es...?`).
3.  **Ensure Appropriate Response (Secondary):** Confirm that Miko attempts to process the command and responds, even if the answer is not yet fully implemented in Spanish.
