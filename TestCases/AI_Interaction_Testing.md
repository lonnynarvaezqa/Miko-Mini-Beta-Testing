# Miko Mini Beta Program: Test Cases Log

## Introduction

This log serves as the official documentation for all **Quality Assurance (QA) test cases** executed during my participation in the Miko Mini Beta Program. The testing activities are directly derived from the weekly challenges and objectives provided by the Miko Beta Team via Slack.

The primary focus of these tests is to validate Miko Mini's core functionality, with a strong emphasis on **Artificial Intelligence (AI) interactions**, **voice recognition**, **multilingual command processing**, and **usability**.

All cycles are documented sequentially below, including the test objectives, detailed steps, expected results, and measurable criteria for success.

---

## Cycle 1: Voice Recognition and Multilingual Command Testing
## üéØ Testing Objectives

This cycle's primary objective is to evaluate Miko Mini's **voice detection, keyword recognition, and language switching capabilities** across different users (child/parent) and accents (natural, non-standard English/Spanish).

The test specifically targets Miko‚Äôs ability to reliably:
1.  **Wake Up:** Recognize the "Hey Miko" wake word from different speakers (child and adult) under various acoustic conditions (natural accent, short pauses).
2.  **Process Multilingual Input:** Accept a command that seamlessly switches from an English trigger ("Hey Miko") to a Spanish request (`¬øcu√°l es...?`).
3.  **Ensure Appropriate Response (Secondary):** Confirm that Miko attempts to process the command and responds, even if the answer is not yet fully implemented in Spanish.

## üõ†Ô∏è Test Cases

The following test cases are based on the required activities for the "Be Miko‚Äôs Voice Coach" challenge.
